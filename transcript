The same argument applies for sex.</p><p>&nbsp;When considering data points that are not personal, there may still be risks. Although Profession is not personal data, we do run the risk of making an individual identifiable if we’re not careful - for example, how many mayors exist in any given town?

The same argument applies for sex.</p><p>&nbsp;When considering data points that are not personal, there may still be risks. Although Profession is not personal data, we do run the risk of making an individual identifiable if we’re not careful - for example, how many mayors exist in any given town?

The same argument applies for sex.</p><p>&nbsp;When considering data points that are not personal, there may still be risks. Although Profession is not personal data, we do run the risk of making an individual identifiable if we’re not careful - for example, how many mayors exist in any given town?

The same argument applies for sex.</p><p>&nbsp;When considering data points that are not personal, there may still be risks. Although Profession is not personal data, we do run the risk of making an individual identifiable if we’re not careful - for example, how many mayors exist in any given town?

While date of birth is personal, the risk of re-identification from this point alone is actually low, however the impact of it being tied to a person is high due to the use of this in many authentication systems, thus medium. The same argument applies for sex.</p><p>&nbsp;When considering data points that are not personal, there may still be risks. Although Profession is not personal data, we do run the risk of making an individual identifiable if we’re not careful - for example, how many mayors exist in any given town? The same could be said for post code. The risk is low in densely populated areas, but for more rural addresses it may not be unusual for a post code to only have a small number of addresses, possibly only one.&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},{"block":{"title":"STEP 4: Anonymise the data","type":"Title"},"components":[{"body":"<p>There are several ways to anonymise data including Suppression, Randomisation, Generalisation and Pseudonymisation.
